# PB2 Zen Launcher
Developed via ElectronJs. A basic launcher that works on Windows 7 and above, MacOS as well as Linux (Ubunutu tested). The installer files will exclude redundant files. 

### Run
You don't need to worry about this if you are using the installer provided in the forums. 

Make sure you have NodeJs as well as npm installed. On the root directory, type `npm i` to install all the dependencies. Type `npm start` to run the application.

### MacOs
You don't need to worry about this if you are using the installer provided in the forums. 

If you are git cloning and running through the source code however, please note that I did not include the flash player for Mac in this git repository. You can obtain the flash player for Mac here: https://www.adobe.com/support/flashplayer/debug_downloads.html

After downloading the flash player, place the entire Flash Player.app in the static folder and it should work now.

### Functionalities
- Caches news so user does not have query PB2 server for news everytime launcher is launched. (launcher works in offline mode.)
- Checks if game is updated / corrupted and redownloads from PB2 server if needed.
- Credentials is stored in a seperate folder (auth), and hidden.

### Possible future features
- Settings option (Light/dark theme toggle, fully customisable launcher's look, option to not close launcher when launching game)
- Centering the game (not possible with NodeJS, may have to extend application with other technologies)
- Discord rich prescence
